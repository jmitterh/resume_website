##### Project Experience
Individual Project: Integration of Live Demo Dataset into Current Platform, Innowatts___________November 2022

*Introduction to Demo Dataset Anonymization at Innowatts*

At Innowatts, I spearheaded the first development of a customer data anonymization process for creating demo datasets. This initiative was aimed at establishing a live demo environment reflecting current market trends and data patterns. The project involved designing a system that not only maintained up-to-date data but also ensured compliance with privacy standards. My role was instrumental in transforming this vision into a functional reality, making the live demo environment a valuable asset for client demonstrations and market analyses.

*Technical Execution and Innovations*

The anonymization process I developed involved complex data handling, beginning with extraction from designated AWS S3 bucket locations, followed by meticulous anonymization and formatting procedures. I employed advanced scripting in this multi-faceted task, ensuring the integrity of data while transforming it into a standardized, anonymized format suitable for analysis and demonstrations. The end-to-end process included deploying scripts on Innowatts’ in-house infrastructure, managing large-scale data processing, and ensuring data security and compliance. This system was optimized to handle the computational demands efficiently, demonstrating significant improvements in both data processing and operational costs.

*Operational Impact and Data Management*

Under my guidance, the anonymization process was integrated into a regular operational schedule, ensuring the constant availability of up-to-date and relevant anonymized data. I established a methodical workflow, including data extraction, processing, and secure re-uploading to AWS S3 in a distinct location for anonymized datasets. This streamlined process greatly enhanced our ability to access and utilize anonymized data across various Athena environments, serving different operational needs from production-level analysis to development and testing. My contributions significantly elevated Innowatts’ capabilities in handling and utilizing large datasets for diverse client and market segments.
