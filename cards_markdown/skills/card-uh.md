#### RhenTech Project - Database Development and Application Architecture

In the RhenTech project, as the Lead Database Developer, I spearheaded the design and approval process of a comprehensive Entity Relational Diagram (ERD) using crow’s foot notation to meet the client's requirements. My role involved scripting and standardizing databases using Microsoft SQL Server 2012, aligning with client-specific naming conventions and data types. In collaboration with a dynamic development team, I applied object-relational mapping principles using Ruby on Rails, ensuring seamless integration of the ERD's tables into the application framework. My responsibilities also included active participation in project management activities, tracking and reporting progress throughout the project lifecycle.
