- Developed Athena tables with standardized parquet datasets, enhancing data processing and business operations. The use of these
tables helps ensure that data is easily accessible and readily available for use in developing invaluable insights for our clients.
- Use Apache Airflow DAGs to ensure daily updates of Athena tables, integrating with the automated process of updating Imply
visualizations.
- Conduct Data Diagnostics to identify any unusual patterns or discrepancies in both raw and processed datasets related to power
and/or natural gas markets. Leverage AWS programmatic access and utilize tools such as Athena or Pandas module to generate
comprehensive reports for the team. These reports provide valuable feedback that supports potential changes or improvements to
the datasets.
- Ingest processed client time-based datasets into Druid datastore. Create analytical dashboards on Imply, ensuring daily refreshes
via Apache Airflow DAG.
- Document comprehensive processes and procedures in Confluence to streamline operations and facilitate effective knowledge
transfer to the team. Part of the Product team, applying Agile sprints bi-weekly with Jira to track stories. Present bi-weekly
progress to create internal awareness and demonstrations.
- Identify and resolve any issues that may arise during product-based processes. Meticulously document these issues to ensure
uninterrupted operations. Using Rancher to review Kubernetes containers that may be experiencing resource issues. Ensuring that
our product-based processes operate seamlessly is achieved by identifying and addressing these issues.
- Responsible for developing custom or standard demo datasets for potential clients interested in the products offered by Innowatts.
The goal is to showcase the full range of capabilities of the organization.
- Develop and owned the new Demo Platform product by writing enterprise-level Python application, which showcases live,
anonymized data to prospective clients during interactive demonstrations.
- Expertise in data visualization using tools like Imply Pivot, matplotlib with Python, and PowerBI.
##### Project Experience
- Individual Project: Integration of Live Demo Dataset into Current Platform, Innowatts___________November 2022
This project involves the development of an internal web-based application that facilitates the connection with AWS S3 to process hourly energy consumption datasets per ISO or Retailer with associated attributes. To ensure privacy and compliance, the dataset will be anonymized as required and subsequently re-ingested into a new bucket within AWS S3.
The web app leverages a Python Django-powered RESTful API and utilizes a range of modules.

- The input mechanism is a pre-defined dropdown that utilizes JSON to generate an array of S3 buckets within the company. This selection allows for seamless access to the appropriate datasets, which in turn, facilitates the data processing and re-ingestion workflows. During the development phase, we prioritize strict adherence to data privacy and security protocols, ensuring all data is handled responsibly and with the utmost ethical consideration.

- The primary objective of this project is to showcase the exceptional capabilities of Innowatts by presenting real-time data to potential clients within our current Platform. By leveraging actual data and demonstrating our expertise, we aim to provide a transparent and comprehensive view of our solutions, thereby establishing a high level of trust with our prospects.
