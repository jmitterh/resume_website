- Developed and maintained cloud-based applications and services such as AWS, Apache Airflow, proprietary application, Apache
Druid, Imply Pivot, focusing on data processing and analytics.
- Utilized AWS services extensively for data storage, processing, and analytics. Configured Athena tables to interact with our energy
application by creating autonomous reports based on clients needs for Forecast and Risk management.
- Implemented proof of concept (POC) projects to generate and refine run-over-run processed forecast data and other novel datasets
using Athena SQL.
- Conduct Data Diagnostics to identify any unusual patterns or discrepancies in both raw and processed datasets related to power
and/or natural gas markets. Leverage AWS programmatic access and utilize tools such as Athena SQL or Pandas module to
generate comprehensive reports for internal analysis. These reports provide valuable feedback that supports potential changes or
improvements to the datasets.
- Configured Apache Airflow DAGs for custom datasets to ingest via Apache Druid.
- Authored detailed process documentation and standard operating procedures in Confluence, enhancing operational efficiency and
supporting seamless knowledge transfer among team members.
- Part of the Product team, applying Agile sprints bi-weekly with Jira to track stories. Present bi-weekly progress to create internal
awareness and demonstrations.
- Identify and resolve any issues that may arise during product-based processes. Document these issues to ensure uninterrupted
operations. Using Kafka or logs from Rancher to review resource issues. Ensuring that our product-based processes operate
seamlessly is achieved by identifying and addressing these issues.
- Led the development of a Demo Platform using cloud-based applications such AWS S3, showcasing live, anonymized data for
client interaction.
- Expertise in data visualization using tools like Imply Pivot, matplotlib with Python, and PowerBI.

##### Project Experience
Individual Project: Integration of Live Demo Dataset into Current Platform, Innowatts___________November 2022

*Introduction to Demo Dataset Anonymization at Innowatts*

At Innowatts, I spearheaded the first development of a customer data anonymization process for creating demo datasets. This initiative was aimed at establishing a live demo environment reflecting current market trends and data patterns. The project involved designing a system that not only maintained up-to-date data but also ensured compliance with privacy standards. My role was instrumental in transforming this vision into a functional reality, making the live demo environment a valuable asset for client demonstrations and market analyses.

*Technical Execution and Innovations*

The anonymization process I developed involved complex data handling, beginning with extraction from designated AWS S3 bucket locations, followed by meticulous anonymization and formatting procedures. I employed advanced scripting in this multi-faceted task, ensuring the integrity of data while transforming it into a standardized, anonymized format suitable for analysis and demonstrations. The end-to-end process included deploying scripts on Innowatts’ in-house infrastructure, managing large-scale data processing, and ensuring data security and compliance. This system was optimized to handle the computational demands efficiently, demonstrating significant improvements in both data processing and operational costs.

*Operational Impact and Data Management*

Under my guidance, the anonymization process was integrated into a regular operational schedule, ensuring the constant availability of up-to-date and relevant anonymized data. I established a methodical workflow, including data extraction, processing, and secure re-uploading to AWS S3 in a distinct location for anonymized datasets. This streamlined process greatly enhanced our ability to access and utilize anonymized data across various Athena environments, serving different operational needs from production-level analysis to development and testing. My contributions significantly elevated Innowatts’ capabilities in handling and utilizing large datasets for diverse client and market segments.
